New Feature Ideas for Yelp

For a Human & Computer Interaction project, I chose to work on analyzing Yelp and adding features targeted more heavily
at the visually focused milennial userbase. I named this new spin-off service "Foodsta" because it reflected how I
incorporated the photo focused design of Instagram into the interface and the focus on resturants and cafes. 
You can find simple mockups of my design in this respository.

After I conducted user observations of the way in which people navigate applications such as Yelp, OpenTable, and Postmates,
I concluded that the most common complaints were that:
1. The reviews and ratings provided can be unreliable, the photos can be misleading, irrelevant, or fail to give a solid
understanding of the interior of the business.
2. Tendency to “cross check” a restaurant’s quality by opening various social media applications and tools to gather a more
accurate depiction.

The common practice of cross checking restaurants with Instagram highlights the significance that photo-evidence holds
for consumers and this area of opportunity for more photo-driven Yelp features. Also food photos are incredibly popular 
especially among social media platform driven and tech savvy millenials - and they make you hungrier! So on each page,
I emphasized the use of food pictures from the restaurants or the thematic categories. 

        Home Page - a dynamic grid of photos with geotags and item names pulled from different social media platforms. This 
                    creates another channel for users to choose a place to go to among a long list of restaurants they are
                    interested in. Getting information from social media posts also guarantees that the photos are real and
                    reliable, and the users know exactly what to expect. It also eliminates the need to cross-check other
                    social media platforms. 

     Explore Page - similar to the Spotify explore page, one page that offers multiple channels to discover restaurants
                    depending on what aspect specifically caters to the user. These include rankings, cuisines, mood and new
                    tastes. Rankings give access to a compiled directory of lists of venue ratings. These can be categorized
                    according to location which Yelp already offers, e.g "Best 10 Brunch Places in Chicago", or according to
                    demographics, e.g "Top 20 Picks of College Students". Mood is similar to a feature Yelp already offers
                    which is giving suggestions for "Romantic Restaurants", "Business Lunch", "Comfort Food", but extends this
                    to a long grid of moods that extend beyond these. This helps users who don't have a specific cuisine or
                    place in mind and need help discovering what fits their wishes. New Tastes offes a page to give user 
                    specific suggestions of restaurants, depending on what venues the user has already tried, reviewed or ranked

      Like Option - likes have major impact on how user's view anything on the internet from photos to people to venues. 
                    Yelp could incorporate likes for venues that provide a sense of how many people enjoy and like the place 
                    without the need for them to include reviews or photos.
